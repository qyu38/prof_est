1. Use "training_sample_establish_no_vehicle_specification" to generate the training sampels, do it separately for training, validating and testing.
2. Use train_GPU_load_separate_FCL to train the model

3. Use test_GPU_separate to view the performane on the testing data set

4. if needed, Use train_GPU_LSTM_transfer.ipynb to fine-tune the model that was initially trained from simulated response,
